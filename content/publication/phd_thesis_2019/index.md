Abstract

Irrigated rice croplands are among the most biologically diverse agroecosystems globally. However, this biodiversity is threatened by agricultural intensification and homogenization of farmed areas, resulting in a degradation of ecosystem services such as natural pest regulation. While evidence exists that increasing landscape heterogeneity in some agroecosystems can enhance natural enemy populations and promote bio-control, little is known about the multi-scale effects of landscape composition and configuration on arthropod communities in rice agroecosystems. In this thesis, I examined the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the distribution of arthropods in three rice-production regions in the Philippines and derived practical recommendations to improve biodiversity and biological control in rice production systems. Through the different chapters of this thesis, I measured landscape heterogeneity at different levels of complexity and spatial scales, and tested its effect on different types of the arthropod biodiversity (taxonomic and functional diversity).

In the introductory chapter, I discussed the ecology and importance of rice agroecosystems. Moreover, I addressed the main problems occurring for the past 50 years regarding pest damage in rice agriculture. Finally, I considered the potential benefits of landscape heterogeneity in enhancing natural enemies' populations and reducing herbivore pests.

The second chapter presents the general methodology used in the following chapters to measure landscape heterogeneity. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified via the calculation of landscape metrics or visual interpretation of remote sensing data. Additionally, I described the two sampling methods used to collect the arthropods in the fields (i.e. sweep net and blow-vac) and the different approaches to measure the diversity of arthropods.

The third chapter describes the arthropod composition in the three regions in the Philippines. Using a visual approach to describe landscape heterogeneity, I found no effect of fine-scale landscape heterogeneity on assemblage structure. Elevation gradient, used as a proxy for regional-scale effects in the study regions, explained more than 60% of variance in assemblage structure, suggesting that regional-scale effects rather than fine-scale landscape heterogeneity explained the composition of rice-arthropod communities in landscapes.

The fourth chapter demonstrates how landscape heterogeneity affected species abundance and species richness of rice arthropods. While predator abundance was solely driven by the availability of prey, all other functional groups in the rice-arthropod community were significantly affected by the composition and configuration of surrounding landscape features.

The fifth chapter highlights the role of landscape heterogeneity as an ecological filter of rice arthropods in relation to particular functional traits (i.e. dispersal ability, functional groups, and favored vertical stratum). I used different statistical analysis (RLQ analyses together with fourth-corner permutation tests) to study rice-arthropods traits across a landscape heterogeneity gradient. The findings of this chapter suggested that both the composition and configuration of the landscape can select or exclude species from the regional pool according to their functional traits.

The concluding chapter synthesizes the major findings highlighting the complex roles landscape heterogeneity plays in determining the arthropod community composition in rice agro-ecosystems. Moreover, I concluded that landscape composition can significantly reduce the presence of rice pests. The rice bunds provide an interesting prospect for ecological engineering applications as they can facilitate the movement of natural enemies and offer them additional shelter and food sources. In addition to landscape heterogeneity, rice arthropods responded to regional-scale effects, and predators displayed a strong numerical response to prey density.

As a perspective for further research, I discussed the limitations of the methods used in the thesis and the prospect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity studies to better understand arthropod composition in rice habitats. The findings of this thesis are the first to quantify the effects of landscape heterogeneity on arthropods in rice agroecosystems. Therefore, this dissertation acts as a pioneer for further research, providing useful initial information for the enhancement of natural biological control at the landscape level.
