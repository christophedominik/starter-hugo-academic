# Description
Land-use intensification is a major threat to biodiversity, affecting natural pest control
and pollination services. While impacts at community levels are well documented, we
focus on a mechanistic understanding of pathways impacting the health of beneficial
arthropods. With field experiments, we will (1) test the effects of resource availability,
landscape structure and pesticide application on the gut microbiome of pollinators
(bumblebees), biocontrol agents (ground beetles) and pest species (pollen beetle) as a
proxy for organismic health, and (2) identify the subsequent impact on performance
(colony performance of bumblebees, abundances of carabids). With our interdisciplinary
team, we seek to support healthy beneficial insect populations for sustainable
agricultural landscapes, with high relevance for the EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy and
Nature Restoration Plan in general.
