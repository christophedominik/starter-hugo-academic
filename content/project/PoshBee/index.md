# Description
[PoshBee](https://poshbee.eu/) (Pan-European assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of stressors on the health of bees) aims to support healthy bee populations, sustainable beekeeping and pollination across Europe. Integrating the knowledge and experience of academics, beekeepers and farmers, PoshBee will:

* provide the first pan-European quantification of the exposure hazard of chemicals to managed and wild bees;  
* determine how chemicals alone, in mixtures, and in combination with pathogens and nutrition, affect bee health, and;  
* meet the need for monitoring tools, novel screening protocols, and practice- and policy-relevant research outputs to local, national, European, and global stakeholders.
