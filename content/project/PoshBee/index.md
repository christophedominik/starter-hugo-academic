# Project  

[PoshBee](http://www.http://poshbee.eu/) (Pan-European assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of stressors on the health of bees) aims to support healthy bee populations, sustainable beekeeping and pollination across Europe. Integrating the knowledge and experience of academics, beekeepers and farmers, PoshBee will:

* provide the first pan-European quantification of the exposure hazard of chemicals to managed and wild bees;  
* determine how chemicals alone, in mixtures, and in combination with pathogens and nutrition, affect bee health, and;  
* meet the need for monitoring tools, novel screening protocols, and practice- and policy-relevant research outputs to local, national, European, and global stakeholders.  

# Objectives and expected outcomes

* Measure hazard: drawing on the expertise of a diverse range of actors, PoshBee will quantify the exposure of honey bees, bumble bees, and solitary bees to chemicals within major agricultural cropping systems across Europe.  

This will fill a major knowledge gap in the exposure hazard of chemicals for bees.  

* Assess toxicity: through the development of innovative protocols and novel model systems, co-created with end-user partners, we will assess toxicity and dynamics of key agrochemicals, and their mixtures, in honey bees, bumble bees, and solitary bees.  

This will provide key information for the development of improved policy and regulations for the safe and sustainable use of agrochemicals in Europe.  

* Estimate health effects: taking a trans-disciplinary approach, we will integrate laboratory, semi-field, field, and landscape studies to provide a holistic understanding of how chemicals, their mixtures, and their interactions with pathogens and nutrition drive health in honey bees, bumble bees, and solitary bees.  

This will help beekeepers and other stakeholders improve bee health management, and fill a major knowledge gap on how hazards interact to threaten bee health.

* Develop a bee health model: within PoshBee we will develop the first mechanistically-underpinned holistic model of bee health.  

This will validate and develop agent-based, landscape-explicit models for risk assessment in honey bees, bumble bees, and solitary bees, building on current MUST-B approaches and working with MUST-B.

* Monitor tools and protocols: we will provide validated tools for the monitoring and assessment of bee health and exposure to stressors.  

This will result in a novel molecular monitoring tool, or ‘health card’ for bees, that measures chemical exposure, pathogens, immune capacities, and nutritional state.

* Drive policy and practice: working together with key stakeholders in the honey bee, agrochemical, farming, pollination service, research, EU policy and regulatory, and bee conservation sectors alike, we will develop a European bee health knowledge exchange hub.  

This will help us synthesize and disseminate our research findings to improve knowledge exchange, and develop best practice protocols, tools, training resources, and policy support for stakeholders across Europe, thereby promoting sustainable beekeeping, bee health, and pollination services.
