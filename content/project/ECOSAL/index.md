The ["ECOSAL ATLANTIS project - Ecotourism in the Atlantic salt-marshes: a strategy for integral and sustainable development"](http://ecosal-atlantis.ua.pt/) is a transnational cooperation project under the European Programme INTERREG IV B Atlantic Area 2007 - 2013, selected by the Monitoring Committee of the Programme (November 2009), which will receive a co-financing (ERDF) of 65% of the total cost of the project, amounting to € 3,059,754.  

The main objective of ECOSAL ATLANTIS is to arrive at a joint, integral and sustainable development in tourism, based on the cultural and natural heritage of traditional salt-producing areas of the Atlantic. The project revolves around three key activities that involve the touristic development of the saltpans of the Atlantic: Heritage, Territorial Development and Biodiversity and Eco-Tourism.  

Included in the project are 13 organizations from 4 countries (Spain, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom) as follows: 1 - Diputación Foral de Alava (project leader), 2 - Ecomuseé du Marais Salant, 3 - Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (DR 17), 4 - Communauté de comunes Océan - Marais de Monts, 5 - Communauté de comunes de l'ile d'Oléron, 6 - Cap Atlantique, 7 - Asociación Cultural Amigos de las Salinas de Interior, 8 - Fundación Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andalucía (Andanatura ), 9 - Bournemouth University, 10 - University of Aveiro, 11 - the Aveiro Municipality, 12 - the Rio Maior Municipality and 13 - the Municipality of Figueira da Foz.  

All participants are united by the goal of creating a tourism trail known as “The Traditional Salt Route of the Atlantic”. The central idea of this route is based on the appreciation of the natural and cultural heritage of salt-producing sites as catalysts for regional development.
To promote the project to the outside world, a newsletter and website have been started, and a logo and posters created. The organization of activities and actions has begun and working groups have met to establish their programs and goals, particularly the creation of an inventory of cultural heritage and biodiversity.   

At the level of individual countries we started off the process of European recognition of the brand and image of “The Traditional Salt Route of the Atlantic" in each of the national languages, in order to establish a unifying concept, which would encourage other sites to be included in the route.
