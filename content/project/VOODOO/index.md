# Project  

[VOODOO](https://voodoo-project.eu/) (Viral eco-evolutionary dynamics of wild and domestic pollinators under global change) aims to support healthy bee populations, sustainable beekeeping and pollination across Europe. Integrating the knowledge and experience of academics, beekeepers and farmers, PoshBee will:

VOODOO will generate new knowledge on the disease risk in different landscapes to pollinators arising from the effects of urban and agricultural land-use on floral resources, pollinator foraging and viral pathogen coinfection and transmission. We will achieve this through measurement of field-sampled plant-pollinator-virus communities with high-resolution molecular analysis, laboratory and field experiments, modelling and analysing perceptions of disease risk among stakeholders.
