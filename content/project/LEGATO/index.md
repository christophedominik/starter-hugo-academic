# Description
[LEGATO](http://www.legato-project.net/) stands for ‘**L**and-use intensity and **E**cological En**g**ineering – **A**ssessment **T**ools for risks and **O**pportunities in irrigated rice based production systems’ and aims to advance long-term sustainable development of irrigated rice fields, against risks arising from multiple aspects of global change. The overall objective is the elaboration and testing of generally applicable principles within the frame of ecological engineering – an emerging discipline, concerned with design, monitoring and construction of ecosystems. 

# Funding
BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research)  
March 2011 to February 2016.
