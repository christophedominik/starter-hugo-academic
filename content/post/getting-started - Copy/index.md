Being a PhD student at the [Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ)](https://www.ufz.de/)
was the best opportunity since it was the perfect combination
of my developed interests for landscape ecology, biological control and tropical
ecosystems. Moreover, to my knowledge, no one had yet investigated the effects
of landscape heterogeneity on arthropods in rice agro-ecosystems. Consequently,
being part of this project felt like I would venture into the unknown. The study
itself required a considerable amount of time in the Philippines to collect the data
and identify the arthropods. Therefore, I spent more than 13 months as a guest
scientist at the [International Rice Research Institute](http://irri.org/) in Los Baños to conduct my
fieldwork, while immersing myself in a new culture. The Philippines is a unique
and wonderful country where people showed me constant kindness and respect.
Someone once said that first impressions are lasting ones. My first introduction to
the Philippines started with a visit of the “eighth wonder of the world”, the rice
terraces of Batad. These hand-carved rice terraces are a remarkable example of a
cultural landscape that is believed to be 2,000 years old. However, rice production
is facing multiple challenges and rice terraces are being abandoned by the younger
generations for more attractive jobs in the cities.  
  
The experience of living in a foreign country and culture can turn into the best
stories, i.e. the simple discovery of a large Atlas beetle (*Chalocosoma atlas*), or
witnessing the power of the typhoons Yolanda and Rammasun (and consequently
living without electricity for two weeks), or just becoming unexpectedly addicted
to video-karaoke. During my PhD, I studied the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the biological control
function in rice agro-ecosystems in the Philippines. The aim was to disentangle the
effects of landscape composition and configuration on rice-arthropod communities
at the landscape level. Therefore, I tried to answer the following
questions:  

1. What is the effect of fine-scale landscape heterogeneity and regional-scale drivers on rice arthropods? Is a binary description of the landscape heterogeneity adequate to identify responses from the rice-arthropod community?
2. How does the composition and configuration of the landscape affect the abundance and species richness of rice-arthropods? Are trophic interactions more important than the effects of landscape heterogeneity on the distribution of rice-arthropods?
3. How does landscape heterogeneity influence species traits of arthropods in rice agro-ecosystems?

## Sampling arthropods in rice fields
  
I sampled the arthropods using two sampling methods: a sweep net method and a
vacuum (blow-vac) method. In irrigated rice fields, the composition of the terrestrial
arthropod community changes with the development of the rice crop and between
cropping seasons. Farmers in the Philippines usually produce
two rice crops per year in the lowlands - one during the dry season (January to
June) and one during the wet season (June to December) - but only one in the
highlands (January-June). The arthropods were sampled when the rice plant was at the
maximum tillering stage (50 days after transplanting) because this
stage is generally associated with a maximum abundance of arthropods.

The sweep net is a simple and inexpensive way to monitor the presence of a
variety of arthropods. The blow-vac machine was operated by a gasoline-powered motor and may be
used for more quantitative studies of arthropods in rice. I used a
custom-built sampling enclosure of about 1 m side length that was placed over
four rice hills to prevent any escape of mobile invertebrates.  

## Identification of arthropods

Once sampled, invertebrates were preserved in 70% ethanol. Most insects were sorted,
counted, and identified using a binocular microscope to species level (or morphospecies
level when species level was not possible); however, dipterans (flies) and collembolans (small detritivores), as well as arachnids (spiders)
were only identified to family level due to the morphological similarity at the preadult
stages and the quality of samples.

In addition, the arthropods were grouped into functional groups as follows: detritivores/tourists, predators, parasitoids and
herbivores.

## Measuring landscape heterogeneity

Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), I described the two main components of landscape heterogeneity:
compositional and configurational heterogeneity. First, I identified and mapped the landscape features around
each sampling site using heads-up digitizing in a geographic information system
[(ArcGIS 10.3, ESRI)](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) based on high resolution SPOT-5 DIMAP images (2.5 m). In addition, I collected ground-truth data to verify the photointerpretation using [Collector for ArcGIS (version 9.3, ESRI)](http://www.esri.com/products/collector-for-arcgis). I randomly attributed
10 ground-truth locations, verified the land cover in the
field and if necessary corrected the digitized maps. Landscape features were classified into eight final
categories: rice bunds, rice fields, plantations, artificial areas, bare soil/grasslands,
woodlands, hydrographic network and ponds. Finally, landscape metrics were calculated at different levels to describe single landscape
elements such as the size or shape of patches, or for whole landscapes by describing
the arrangement of patches and composition of the landscape.

## Main findings

The availability of non-crop habitats at the ecotone of the rice habitat and the spatial arrangement of the rice habitat
can benefit natural enemies and reduce pest densities. The rice bunds provide an
interesting prospect for ecological engineering applications as they can facilitate
the movement of natural enemies and offer them additional shelter and resources.  
  
In addition, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the rice habitat may benefit
generalist predators via landscape supplementation.
The methods that have been used in this thesis have showed the importance
of adopting modern tools to quantify the landscape heterogeneity of rice agroecosystems.  

Finally, the results of my thesis act as a pioneer for further landscape ecology approaches in rice
agro-ecosystems, and its findings provide useful information for the enhancement
of natural biological control at the landscape level.
