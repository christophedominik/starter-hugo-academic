I am an ecologist looking at patterns of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services at different spatial and temporal scales. As a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Community Ecology at the [Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ)](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=38591), I am currently investigating how pollinators and the services they provide are influenced by landscape and land-use intensity.  

My main research interests focus on landscape ecology, macroecology, agro-ecology, pollination services and biological control. I use different approaches and methods to better understand the effects of landscape on communities and ecosystems services, both in temperate (Europe) and tropical regions (South-East Asia).
