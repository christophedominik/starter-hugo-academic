summary: "The effects of landscape heterogeneity on arthropod communities in tropical rice agro-ecosystems"
abstract: "Irrigated rice croplands are among the most biologically diverse agroecosystems
globally. However, this biodiversity is threatened by agricultural intensification and
homogenization of farmed areas, resulting in a degradation of ecosystem services
such as natural pest regulation. While evidence exists that increasing landscape
heterogeneity in some agroecosystems can enhance natural enemy populations
and promote bio-control, little is known about the multi-scale effects of landscape
composition and configuration on arthropod communities in rice agroecosystems. In
this thesis, I examined the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the distribution
of arthropods in three rice-production regions in the Philippines and derived
practical recommendations to improve biodiversity and biological control in rice
production systems. Through the different chapters of this thesis, I measured
landscape heterogeneity at different levels of complexity and spatial scales, and
tested its effect on different types of the arthropod biodiversity (taxonomic and
functional diversity)."
