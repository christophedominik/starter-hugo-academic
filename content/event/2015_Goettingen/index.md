summary: "Effects of landscape structures on rice agroecosystem biodiversity and biological control across the Philippines"
abstract: "In the Asian rice agro ecosystems, pests like the brown planthopper (BPH) and the white-backed planthopper (WBPH) are major threats to rice production, causing significant yield loss. The misuse of pesticides in rice production destroys the natural biocontrol mechanisms because natural enemies are just as susceptible to the pesticides as the pest. While it is hypothesized that habitat diversity and landscape complexity can enhance natural enemy populations and thus benefit crop production by reducing pests, the effects of landscape structure in rice agro-ecosystems are largely unknown. This study aims to test the potential influence of landscape complexity on the distribution of specific species representative for the given predator-prey system. We use a landscape ecology approach to examine the effects of spatial configuration and temporal land use regimes on the distribution of rice pests and pest-controlling species at a regional scale. Landscape composition and configuration affect guild composition and species richness of the arthropod community but responses varied with taxa. The two main pests of rice (BPH and WBPH) respond differently to the landscape structures, but in general, overall arthropod species richness decreased with the area of rice fields in the landscape. Better understanding the role of landscape complexity in biological control will benefit crop production and result in increased sustainability of the farming system. Protection of non-crop habitats can also enhance a range of cultural services such as the aesthetic value of the landscape, cultural heritage and eco-tourism."
